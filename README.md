# RGB.NET

This is a modification of DarthAffe's RGB.NET project, it adds corsair ST100 headset stand support and allows retrieval of Asus motherboard color information.

This project aims to unify the use of various RGB-devices.   
**It is currently under heavy development and will have breaking changes in the future!** Right now a lot of devices aren't working as expected and there are bugs/unfinished features. Please think about that when you consider using the library in this early stage.   
   
If you want to help with layouting/testing devices or if you need support using the library feel free to join the [RGB.NET discord-channel](https://discord.gg/9kytURv).
